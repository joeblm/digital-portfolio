```{tab-item} Things I learned
- The jupyterbook.org is a great resource. Very easy to follow and to find what I was looking for.
- Some build errors are fixed by installing missing python packages. I guess when we build a book, it runs the cells in the notebooks and we have to make sure to have all the pre-requisites for those notebooks.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- Adding tags to cells
- Still not clear how the analysis_example notebook works within the Jupyter Book, and it gives me an error about the conda env. sometimes when I build.
- Citations doesn't look how I would expect them to.
